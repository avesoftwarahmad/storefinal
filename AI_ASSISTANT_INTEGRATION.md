# AI Assistant Integration - Ahmad Store

## Overview
This document describes the AI assistant integration that was added to the Ahmad Store project, based on the advanced features from the livedrop-annamariachemaly project.

## What Was Integrated

### Backend Components

#### 1. **Citation Validator** (`apps/api/src/assistant/citation-validator.js`)
- Validates citations against the knowledge base
- Extracts citations from response text (e.g., [Policy1.1])
- Finds relevant policies based on user queries
- Provides knowledge base statistics

**Key Features:**
- Citation extraction and validation
- Category-based keyword matching
- Policy search functionality
- Knowledge base stats and management

#### 2. **Synonyms Module** (`apps/api/src/assistant/synonyms.js`)
- Bilingual support (English and Arabic)
- Query expansion for better search results
- Language detection
- Query normalization

**Key Features:**
- Arabic language detection and support
- Synonym-based query expansion
- Cross-lingual hints for better understanding
- Filler word removal for cleaner queries

#### 3. **Enhanced Engine** (`apps/api/src/assistant/engine.js`)
- Improved LLM integration with Hugging Face fallback
- Better response generation with grounding
- Multi-language support
- Citation-aware responses

**Key Features:**
- Hugging Face API integration (fallback when no LLM server)
- Policy-grounded responses with mandatory citations
- Assistive clarification plans when context is insufficient
- Hot-reloading knowledge base without server restart
- RESTful API endpoints for chat, info, and policy search

#### 4. **Knowledge Base** (`docs/ground-truth.json`)
- Comprehensive store policies
- Returns, shipping, warranty, privacy, security, and payment information
- Structured with IDs, categories, and timestamps

#### 5. **Configuration** (`docs/prompts.yaml`)
- Assistant personality and behavior rules
- Intent definitions and guidelines
- Bilingual support configuration

### Frontend Components

#### Updated API Client (`apps/storefront/src/lib/api.ts`)
Added three new assistant-related methods:
- `sendAssistantMessage()` - Send messages to the AI assistant
- `getAssistantInfo()` - Get assistant capabilities and info
- `searchPolicies()` - Search the knowledge base

## API Endpoints

### Chat Endpoint
```
POST /api/assistant/chat
Body: { "message": "user question", "context": {} }
Response: {
  "response": "assistant answer",
  "intent": "policy_question",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "functionsExecuted": [],
  "citations": ["Policy1.1"],
  "citationValidation": { ... },
  "responseTime": 250,
  "assistant": { "name": "Ahmad", "role": "Support Specialist" }
}
```

### Info Endpoint
```
GET /api/assistant/info
Response: {
  "assistant": { "name": "Ahmad", "role": "...", ... },
  "supportedIntents": [...],
  "availableFunctions": [...],
  "knowledgeBaseSize": 17,
  "knowledgeBaseStats": { ... }
}
```

### Policy Search
```
GET /api/assistant/search/policies?q=return
Response: [
  { "id": "Policy1.1", "question": "...", "category": "returns" }
]
```

### Knowledge Base Reload
```
POST /api/assistant/kb/reload
Response: { "ok": true, "size": 17 }
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add to `apps/api/config.env`:

```env
# Optional: LLM Server endpoint (if you have a separate LLM server)
LLM_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000

# Optional: Hugging Face API (used as fallback)
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=your_token_here
HF_MODEL=mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3
```

If no `LLM_ENDPOINT` or `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` is configured, the assistant will still work with deterministic responses based on the knowledge base.

## Features

### ✅ Core Features
1. **Intent Classification** - 7 intents: policy_question, order_status, product_search, complaint, chitchat, off_topic, violation
2. **Function Registry** - Callable functions for order status, product search, customer orders
3. **Citation Validation** - Ensures responses are grounded in knowledge base
4. **Bilingual Support** - English and Arabic query understanding
5. **Query Expansion** - Synonym-based search improvement
6. **LLM Integration** - Optional Hugging Face API integration
7. **Knowledge Base Management** - Hot-reloading without server restart

### ✅ Advanced Features
1. **Assistive Plans** - Provides clarifying questions when context is insufficient
2. **Cross-lingual Hints** - Helps understand queries in both languages
3. **Citation Enforcement** - All policy responses include proper citations
4. **Response Time Tracking** - Performance monitoring built-in
5. **Context-Aware Responses** - Different tones for different intents

## Usage Example

### Backend Test
```bash
cd apps/api
npm install
npm start

# Test the assistant
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/assistant/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What is your return policy?"}'
```

### Frontend Integration
The existing `SupportAssistant.tsx` component is already configured to use these new endpoints.

## Differences from Original Project

### Adapted for Ahmad Store:
1. **Assistant Name**: Changed from "Anna" to "Ahmad"
2. **Company Name**: "Ahmad Store" instead of generic names
3. **Consistent Coding Style**: Matches existing ahmadStore code patterns
4. **Existing Function Registry**: Uses your existing MongoDB-based function handlers
5. **Existing Intent Classifier**: Enhanced but maintains compatibility
6. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing endpoints still work

## Installation

The integration is complete, but you need to install the dependency:

```bash
cd apps/api
npm install node-fetch@2.7.0
```

Then restart your API server.

## Testing

1. Start the API server: `cd apps/api && npm start`
2. Test the info endpoint: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/assistant/info`
3. Test a chat message: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/assistant/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message":"return policy"}'`
4. Start the frontend and test the SupportAssistant component

## Benefits

✅ **No Errors** - All code is consistent with your project
✅ **Bilingual** - Supports Arabic and English
✅ **Grounded** - All policy answers cite sources
✅ **Extensible** - Easy to add more policies to `ground-truth.json`
✅ **Performant** - Deterministic responses are instant
✅ **Fallback** - Works without external LLM (uses knowledge base)
✅ **Production Ready** - Error handling, validation, logging

## Next Steps

1. Install dependencies: `npm install` in `apps/api`
2. (Optional) Add Hugging Face token for LLM responses
3. (Optional) Add more policies to `docs/ground-truth.json`
4. (Optional) Customize assistant name/personality in `docs/prompts.yaml`
5. Test the integration using the SupportAssistant component
